The peculiarity of this repository is that the source of information is structured into CSV files with a simple structure.
See the `data/` directory.

If you want to contribute using a pull request, add the new entry to `data/apps.csv`.
In the CSV file, the `git` field refers to a **clonable git URL**.

Please make changes **to the CSV file only**, **not to the README file**.
I will review the request and, upon acceptance, I will take care of generating the README and updating the list.

## Contribution via email

If you prefer an email, contact me at `toolleeo@gmail.com` by sending the same information required for the "open an issue" method.

# Generation of the README file

If necessary, this `README` file can be (re-)generated from the CSV files.
To build `README.md` run:

```
make
```

`python3` is required for building. And `make`, of course. :-)
